Video Game Sales Analysis is a personal project that aims to provide insightful data on the video game industry for game publishers. Using Kaggle's [Video Game Sales 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/video-game-sales-2024) and [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started), I pulled data including but not limited to regional sales, genre saturation, and publisher platform diversity. In this project, I present business metrics as well as correlations between popularity score (provided by IGDB) to sales and sales to predicted proxy ROI. That way, the publishers get useful insights into how their games perform under various factors and help them make decisions for future marketing and release of their games. I present these findings using Power BI dashboard.
