# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis
This project aims to provide insightful data on the video game industry for game publishers. Using Kaggle's [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) data from 1971 to 2016 and [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started), I pulled data including but not limited to regional sales, genre & publishers, and engagement scores. In this project, I present business metrics as well as correlations between popularity score (provided by IGDB) to sales. 

## 💡 Purpose
Publishers get useful insights into how their games perform under various factors and help them make decisions for future marketing and release of their games. I present these findings using a Power BI dashboard.

## 📚 Data
The dataset combines historical video game sales data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) with popularity and metadata from the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started), providing a consolidated view of the global gaming market over time.
